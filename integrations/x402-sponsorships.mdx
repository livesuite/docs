Our platform integrates with the x402 payment protocol, an internet-native payment system that uses HTTP 402 "Payment Required" status codes for seamless cryptocurrency payments. This integration enables users to sponsor content creators and token communities directly through our platform, with automatic payment handling via the Solana blockchain.

## What is x402?

The x402 payment protocol is a revolutionary approach to internet payments that:

- Uses HTTP 402 status code (originally reserved for payment systems)
- Enables automatic payment interception and processing
- Supports native cryptocurrency payments (USDC on Solana)
- Provides seamless payment flows without redirects or external payment pages
- Integrates directly into existing HTTP-based APIs

## Partnership with Pyro.buzz

We have partnered with Pyro.buzz to provide seamless sponsorship capabilities for content creators and token communities. Pyro.buzz operates the x402 payment service that handles:

### Sponsor Management

- Token-based sponsorships (promoting specific tokens)
- External community sponsorships (promoting external projects/communities)
- Dynamic pricing based on content engagement and market conditions

### Payment Processing

- Automatic USDC payment collection
- Transaction verification and confirmation
- Payment receipt generation and logging

### Content Promotion

- Integration with Pyro's creator ecosystem
- Real-time sponsorship tracking
- Burn and swap transaction management

## How It Works

Our x402 integration follows a streamlined flow:

### 1. Sponsor Selection

- Users browse available sponsors from the 402 API
- Each sponsor has associated costs in USD
- Sponsors can be token-based or external communities

### 2. Cost Calculation

- System queries the 402 API for current sponsorship costs
- Costs are dynamic and based on market conditions
- Users see real-time pricing before committing

### 3. Validation Phase

- Before payment, sponsorship details are validated
- 402 API confirms sponsor availability and pricing
- System prepares execution payload with required data

### 4. Payment Execution

- Uses x402-axios library for automatic payment handling
- Library intercepts HTTP 402 responses
- Automatically creates and signs Solana payment transactions
- Retries request with payment header after transaction confirmation

### 5. Transaction Flow

- If user has sufficient USDC: Direct payment from existing balance
- If user needs more USDC: Automatic SOL-to-USDC swap via Jupiter Aggregator
- Transaction is broadcast to Solana network

### 6. Confirmation

- 402 API confirms successful payment
- Sponsorship is activated
- User receives confirmation with transaction signatures
