title: "Exit Strategy"
description: "Exit strategy and value distribution for $LIVE token holders."
---

In the event of an acquisition, buyout, or merger involving LiveSuite, a percentage of the value accrued from these events will be shared with $LIVE token holders based on their holdings (% based).

## Value Distribution

Token holders will receive their proportional share of the exit value based on:

- **Percentage Holdings**: Your share of the total $LIVE supply determines your portion of the distribution
- **Exit Value**: A percentage of the total acquisition, buyout, or merger value will be allocated to token holders
- **Fair Distribution**: All holders benefit proportionally from the platform's success
