## Setting Up in OBS

Setting up widgets in OBS is straightforward:

**Step 1: Get Your Widget URL**

Use the [Widget Visualizer](https://livesuite.app/visualizer/) or copy a widget URL from the individual widget pages. Each widget page has example URLs you can customize.

**Step 2: Add Browser Source**

1. In OBS Studio, right-click in your **Sources** panel
2. Select **Add** → **Browser Source**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Stream Timer")
4. Click **OK**

**Step 3: Configure**

1. **URL:** Paste your widget URL
2. **Width:** Set to `1920` (or your stream resolution width)
3. **Height:** Set to `1080` (or your stream resolution height)
4. Check **Shutdown source when not visible**
5. Click **OK**

**Step 4: Position and Size**

Your widget appears in the preview. Drag it to position, resize by dragging corners, and adjust as needed.

<Tip>
  For overlays, smaller sizes work better. Try starting with 400-600px width.
</Tip>
