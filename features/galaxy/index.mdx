Experience pump.fun livestream data in a completely new way. Galaxy is our 3D interactive visualization that transforms token data into a spatial, immersive environment.

## What is Galaxy?

Galaxy is a three-dimensional visualization of all active livestreams on pump.fun. Each token appears as a point in space, positioned and sized based on real-time data. Navigate through the cosmos of tokens, explore relationships, and discover patterns that aren't visible in traditional charts.

**Features:**
- Smooth 3D rendering
- High performance
- Real-time data integration
- Intuitive navigation controls

## Features

**3D Spatial Representation:**
Tokens are positioned in 3D space based on their metrics. Position, size, and color all represent different data points.

**Real-Time Updates:**
As streams go live or viewer counts change, the visualization updates in real-time. Watch the galaxy evolve as activity happens.

**Interactive Exploration:**
- Rotate the view
- Zoom in and out
- Click tokens to see details
- Navigate through the space

**Immersive Experience:**
Full-screen mode for the best experience. Let the data surround you.

## Accessing Galaxy

Galaxy is available as a standalone application:

**Direct Access:**
Visit `galaxy.livesuite.app` for the full experience.

**From LiveSuite:**
You can also navigate to Galaxy from the main LiveSuite application.

## How It Works

Galaxy pulls real-time data as it happens. As users join streams, leave streams, or send messages, the visualization responds immediately.

**Data Integration:**
- Live stream data
- Viewer counts
- User movements
- Message activity
- Market cap data

**Visual Mapping:**
Different aspects of token data map to visual properties:
- Token size might represent market cap
- Color could indicate viewer count
- Position reflects relationships or activity
- Movement shows real-time changes

## Use Cases

**Discovery:**
Explore tokens you might not have noticed in traditional lists. The spatial layout can reveal hidden patterns.

**Research:**
Get a different perspective on platform activity. See the big picture of what's happening across all streams.

**Presentation:**
Galaxy makes a great visual for streams, videos, or presentations. Show the ecosystem in action.

**Fun:**
Sometimes data visualization should be enjoyable. Galaxy makes exploring pump.fun data an experience.

## Performance

Galaxy is optimized for smooth performance even with many active tokens. You'll get high frame rates and responsive interactions.

**Requirements:**
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Decent graphics card for best experience
- Stable internet connection for real-time updates

<Tip>
  Galaxy works best in full-screen mode. Press F11 or use your browser's fullscreen option for the immersive experience.
