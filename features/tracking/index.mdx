LiveSuite tracks pump.fun livestreams in real-time, providing accurate data on viewer counts, streaming sessions, and token activity. Everything updates automatically as streams go live or go offline.

## Live Stream Tracking

We continuously monitor all active streams, updating data every 30 seconds to keep everything current.

**What We Track:**
- Active livestreams across the platform
- Viewer counts for each token
- Stream status (live/offline)
- New token launches
- Session start and end times

We monitor streams using multiple methods to catch all active streams and ensure we don't miss anything.

## Streaming Sessions

Every stream gets tracked as a session with start time, duration, and viewer metrics.

**How Sessions Work:**
1. **Starts** - When a stream goes live, a new session begins
2. **Updates** - Viewer counts and duration update while streaming
3. **Resumes** - If a stream pauses and comes back, the session continues
4. **Ends** - When offline, the session is saved with total stats

**Session Data Includes:**
- Start and end timestamps
- Total streaming duration
- Peak viewer count
- Average viewers
- Total streaming time
