## Analysis Types

**1. Reality Check Patterns**
Looks for unnatural viewer count patterns that don't match normal behavior.

**2. Temporal Pattern Analysis**
Analyzes timing patterns—do viewers appear and disappear in suspicious ways?

**3. Market Cap Correlation**
Checks if viewer counts correlate appropriately with market cap changes.

**4. Peak Timing Analysis**
Examines when peak viewers occur relative to other events.

**5. Statistical Anomaly Detection**
Finds statistical outliers in viewer data that suggest manipulation.

**6. Growth Pattern Analysis**
Reviews how viewer counts grow—natural vs. artificial patterns.

## Confidence Levels

Each analysis contributes to an overall confidence score (0-100):

- **Low (0-40)** - Unlikely to be botting, normal patterns
- **Medium (41-70)** - Some suspicious patterns, worth investigating
- **High (71-100)** - Strong indicators of botting activity
