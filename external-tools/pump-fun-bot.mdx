## Usage

There are two ways to use the Pump Fun Bot:

### 1. Custom Commands & Auto Moderator

If the streamer sets up custom commands and the auto moderator through the LiveSuite web app, the bot will use those custom configurations. This allows streamers to create personalized commands and automated moderation rules.

### 2. Default Commands

All streams have default commands enabled that work automatically:

- `!x` - Shows the token's X (Twitter) link
- `!website` - Shows the token's website link
- `!web` - Shows the token's website link
- `!twitter` - Shows the token's Twitter/X link
- `!telegram` - Shows the token's Telegram link
- `!dex` - Shows information regarding the token's DexScreener orders

## How It Works

The default commands (`!x`, `!website`, `!web`, `!twitter`, `!telegram`) automatically pull from the token's metadata and display the corresponding social media or website links.

The `!dex` command displays information about the token's DexScreener orders, providing real-time trading data and order book information.
