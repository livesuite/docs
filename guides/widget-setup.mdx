This guide walks you through setting up LiveSuite widgets in OBS Studio. It's easier than you think!

## Prerequisites

- OBS Studio installed
- Your token's mint address
- A LiveSuite widget URL

## Step 1: Get Your Widget URL

First, choose which widget you want to use. Head to the [Widgets documentation](/features/widgets/index) to see all available types.

**Common widget URLs look like:**
- Timer: `https://livesuite.app/widgets/obs-timer/YOUR_MINT_ID`
- Market Cap Goal: `https://livesuite.app/widgets/marketcap-goal/YOUR_MINT_ID/1000000`
- Holder Count: `https://livesuite.app/widgets/holder-count/YOUR_MINT_ID`

Replace `YOUR_MINT_ID` with your actual token mint address.

<Tip>
  You can find your mint address on pump.fun or in your token's URL. It's the long string of characters after `/token/`.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Add Browser Source in OBS

1. In OBS Studio, right-click in your **Sources** panel
2. Select **Add** → **Browser Source**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Stream Timer" or "Market Cap Goal")
4. Click **OK**

## Step 3: Configure the Browser Source

In the Browser Source settings:

1. **URL:** Paste your widget URL here
2. **Width:** Set to `1920` (or your stream resolution width)
3. **Height:** Set to `1080` (or your stream resolution height)
4. Check **Shutdown source when not visible** (saves resources)
5. **Custom CSS:** Leave blank unless you need custom styling
6. Click **OK**

## Step 4: Position and Size

Your widget should appear in your preview. You can:
- Drag it to position it where you want
- Resize it by dragging the corners
- Adjust transparency if needed

<Tip>
  For overlays, smaller sizes work better. Try starting with 400-600px width and adjust to fit your design.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Test It

1. Make sure your token is live on pump.fun
2. Check that the widget is updating (viewer counts, timers, etc. should change)
3. Preview your stream to see how it looks

## Multiple Widgets

You can add multiple widgets to the same scene:

1. Repeat steps 2-4 for each widget
2. Position them in different locations
3. Name them clearly so you can find them later

Common combinations:
- Timer + Market Cap Goal
- Token Stats + Ranking
- Holder Count + Creator Fees Goal

## Common Issues

**Widget not showing:**
- Check that the URL is correct (including the mint ID)
- Make sure your token is currently live
- Try refreshing the browser source (right-click → Refresh)

**Widget not updating:**
- Widgets update every few seconds, so small delays are normal
- If it's been stuck for more than 30 seconds, check your internet connection
- Make sure "Shutdown source when not visible" is checked

**Widget too big/small:**
- Adjust the width/height in browser source settings
- Or resize it directly in OBS by dragging the corners

**Transparency issues:**
- Widgets support transparent backgrounds by default
- If you see a white background, check your widget's settings or try a different widget type

## Advanced: Custom Styling

Some widgets support URL parameters for custom styling. Check the widget documentation for available parameters.

Example:
```
https://livesuite.app/widgets/obs-timer/YOUR_MINT_ID?color=ffffff&fontSize=24
```

## Saving Your Setup

Once you have your widgets configured:
1. Save your scene in OBS
2. Your widget configurations are saved automatically
3. They'll load the next time you open OBS

If you're logged into LiveSuite, you can also save widget configurations in your dashboard for easy reference.
