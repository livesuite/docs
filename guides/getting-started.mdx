Welcome to LiveSuite! This guide will get you up and running quickly, whether you're a streamer setting up widgets or a trader exploring analytics.

## For Streamers

If you're streaming on pump.fun, here's what you need to know:

### 1. Explore Your Token

Start by searching for your token on LiveSuite. You can search by:
- Token name
- Symbol
- Mint address

Once you find it, you'll see:
- Real-time viewer counts
- Streaming session history
- Analytics and charts
- Peak performance metrics

### 2. Set Up OBS Widgets

OBS widgets are the easiest way to enhance your stream. Here's the quick version:

1. Go to the [Widgets page](/features/widgets/index) to see all available widgets
2. Choose a widget type (timer, market cap goal, holder count, etc.)
3. Copy the widget URL with your token's mint ID
4. In OBS, add a Browser Source
5. Paste the URL
6. Adjust size and position

That's it! The widget updates automatically.

### 3. Track Your Progress

Use the analytics dashboard to:

- Analyze your streaming patterns

## For Traders

If you're trading or researching tokens:

### 1. Browse Active Streams

The main dashboard shows all active streams with:
- Current viewers
- Market cap
- Streaming time
- Sortable columns

Use this to find opportunities and track what's hot.

### 2. Use Analytics

The analytics dashboard provides:
- Market cap distributions
- Activity heatmaps
- Trending patterns
- Financial metrics

Look for:
- Unusual activity patterns (could signal momentum)
- High viewer-to-market-cap ratios (potential undervaluation)
- Consistent streaming (indicates dedicated communities)

### 3. Try the Tools
